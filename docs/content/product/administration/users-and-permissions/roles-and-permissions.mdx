# Roles & Permissions

_Understanding user roles and permissions in Cube._

Cube has four built-in default roles: Admin, Developer, Explorer, and Viewer. Each role has specific permissions and access levels designed to support different responsibilities within the platform.

The Enterprise tier allows creation of custom roles with a customized set of permissions tailored to your organization's specific needs.

## Agent Permissions

Agents are connected to Semantic Model Deployments and inherit the permission level of the user they are operating under.

Each agent can be configured to use the _Restrict Views_ feature which allows to select the views that are visible to the agent.
This feature should not be used as a security measure. Configure [access policies][ref-data-access-policies] instead.

## Typical Usage Scenarios

- Explorers: Typically data consumers and analysts
- Developers: Usually data stewards and data engineers
- Admins: Typically assigned to data engineers managing the entire Cube instance (billed at the developer rate with additional privileges)
